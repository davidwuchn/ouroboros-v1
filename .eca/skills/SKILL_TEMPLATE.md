# Skill Name

## Identity

You are a [role]. Your mindset is shaped by:
- **Figure A** - key principle
- **Figure B** - key principle

Your tone is [quality]; your goal is [outcome].

---

## Core Principle

One paragraph defining the unique value this skill provides.

---

## Procedure

```
λ(input).transform ⟺ [
  step_one(input),
  step_two(result),
  step_three(result),
  output(result)
]
```

---

## Decision Matrix

| Input Pattern | Action | Output |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Pattern A | Do X | Result |
| Pattern B | Do Y | Result |

---

## Examples

**Good Input**: "Specific, actionable request"
```
Response format
```

**Bad Input**: "Vague, slop request"
```
Response format
```

---

## Verification

```
λ(output).verify ⟺ [
  check_one(output) AND
  check_two(output) AND
  check_three(output)
]
```

## Self-Improvement Notes (λ(self))

> *Document how this skill should evolve through use.*

After using this skill 5+ times, analyze:

### Usage Patterns
- [ ] **Which sections were most useful?**
- [ ] **Which were ignored or skipped?**
- [ ] **What friction did users encounter?**

### Scope Verification
```
λ(skill).maintain ⟺ [
  size < 200_lines?          [ ] YES  [ ] NO → Simplify
  single_purpose?            [ ] YES  [ ] NO → Split
  unique_value > 0?          [ ] YES  [ ] NO → Remove
  overlap_with_others = 0?   [ ] YES  [ ] NO → Merge/Refactor
]
```

### Improvement Log

| Date | Observation | Action Taken | Result |
|------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Example: "Decision Matrix never used" | Removed, folded into Procedure | Skill 20% shorter |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Example: "Users confused about when to use" | Added explicit "When to Use" header | Clearer scope |

### Evolution Triggers

**Simplify when:**
- Skill exceeds 200 lines
- Users ask "which skill should I use?"
- Sections go unused across multiple sessions

**Split when:**
- Skill handles multiple distinct workflows
- "When to use" requires OR conditions
- Sections serve different user types

**Merge when:**
- Another skill has overlapping concerns
- Users switch between them frequently
- Duplication identified in comparison

### Fixed Point Criteria

This skill reaches completion when:
- [ ] Can be explained in 2 sentences
- [ ] Every section serves the core purpose
- [ ] No duplication with other skills
- [ ] Users know immediately when to use it

## Summary

**When to use this skill**:
1. Trigger condition
2. Trigger condition
3. Trigger condition

**Framework eliminates slop, not adds process.**
