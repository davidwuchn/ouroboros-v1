# Task Plan: [Brief Description]

<!--
  φ: This is your roadmap. Working memory on disk.
  WHY: After 50+ tool calls, goals get forgotten. This keeps them fresh.
  WHEN: Create FIRST. Update after each phase.
-->

---

## Goal (e — Purpose)

<!--
  One clear sentence describing the end state.
  This is your north star. Re-read to stay focused.
  EXAMPLE: "Create a Clojure CLI tool that converts EDN to JSON."
-->

[One sentence describing the end state]

## Current Phase

<!-- Quick reference for where you are. Update as you progress. -->

**Phase:** [e.g., "Phase 1: Discovery"]

---

## Phases

<!--
  Break task into 3-7 logical phases.
  Each phase should be completable and testable.
  Update status: pending → in_progress → complete
-->

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery (φ)

<!-- τ: Understand before building -->

- [ ] Understand user intent
- [ ] Identify constraints and requirements
- [ ] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** `in_progress`

<!--
  STATUS VALUES:
  - pending: Not started
  - in_progress: Currently working
  - complete: Finished, verified
  - blocked: Cannot proceed (document why)
-->

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure (π)

<!-- π: Synthesize findings into structure -->

- [ ] Define technical approach
- [ ] Create project structure
- [ ] Document decisions with rationale
- **Status:** `pending`

### Phase 3: Implementation (Δ)

<!-- Δ: Execute and track changes -->

- [ ] Build solution step by step
- [ ] Test incrementally
- [ ] Log progress in progress.md
- **Status:** `pending`

### Phase 4: Verification (∀)

<!-- ∀: Defensive checking -->

- [ ] Verify all requirements met
- [ ] Run tests / validate outputs
- [ ] Document results in progress.md
- **Status:** `pending`

### Phase 5: Delivery (μ)

<!-- μ: Direct, no fluff -->

- [ ] Review all deliverables
- [ ] Clean up temporary files
- [ ] Hand off to user
- **Status:** `pending`

## Key Questions

<!-- π: Questions to answer during the task -->

1. [Question to answer]
2. [Question to answer]
3. [Question to answer]

## Decisions Made

<!-- τ: Record why choices were made -->

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| | | |

---

## Blockers & Risks

<!-- ∀: What could go wrong? -->

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| | | |

---

## Errors Encountered

<!-- ∃: Log all errors to prevent repetition -->

| Error | Attempt | Resolution | Timestamp |
|-------|---------|------------|-----------|
| | | | |

---

## Notes

<!-- Free-form notes, reminders, context -->

- Update phase status as you progress
- Re-read this plan before major decisions
- Log ALL errors — they prevent repetition
- Never repeat a failed action — mutate approach

---

## Completion Checklist

<!-- ∀: Verify before finishing -->

- [ ] All phases marked `complete`
- [ ] findings.md contains research
- [ ] progress.md contains session log
- [ ] No orphaned temporary files
- [ ] User delivered working solution
