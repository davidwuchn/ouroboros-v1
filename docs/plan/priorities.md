## Focus Areas

### 1. Wire New Architecture

```clojure
;; Use component lifecycle
(defcomponent system
  :start (start-all!)
  :stop (stop-all!))

;; Use signal bus
(signal/publish! :tool/execute {:tool :file/read})

;; Use statechart
(sm/transition! :eca-ooda :orient)
```

### 2. Wisdom System

- ✅ Split `wisdom.clj` (643 LOC → 369, templates extracted)
- ⚒ Batch endpoint implemented (3 → 2 WS requests, target: 4 → 1)
- ◐ Connect to learning namespace

### 3. Learning Activation

Implement the Learning Flywheel UI:
- Utility → Understanding → Insight → Wisdom
- Spaced repetition system
- Connect to ECA wisdom pipeline
