## System Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Engine (∅) | ✓ Running | Statechart lifecycle operational |
| Query | ✓ Active | Pathom EQL interface exposed |
| Interface | ✓ Ready | Unified boot/shutdown via `ouroboros.interface` |
| nREPL | ✓ Port 8888 | Auto-boots system on connect |
| History | ✓ Active | Git resolvers for commits, status, branches |
| Introspection | ✓ Active | Engine queries its own statechart |
| Memory | ✓ Active | Cross-session persistence via EDN |
| Knowledge | ✓ Active | File system as queryable graph |
| API | ✓ Active | HTTP client via Pathom resolvers |
| **OpenAPI** | **✓ New** | **OpenAPI specs → callable clients via Martian** |

**Verified Working:**
```clojure
;; System queries
(iface/q [:system/status])
=> {:system/status {:state #{:running :system}, :running? true, :ready? true},
    :system/healthy? true}

;; Git queries  
(iface/q [{:git/commits [:git/hash :git/subject]} :git/status])
=> {:git/commits [{:git/hash "...", :git/subject "..."} ...]
    :git/status {:status/branch "main", :status/clean? false}}

;; Introspection queries
(iface/q [:introspection/configuration :introspection/available-events])
=> {:introspection/configuration [:ouroboros.engine/running :ouroboros.engine/system]
    :introspection/available-events ["stop"]}

;; Introspection queries
(iface/q [:introspection/configuration :introspection/available-events])
=> {:introspection/configuration [:ouroboros.engine/running :ouroboros.engine/system]
    :introspection/available-events ["stop"]}

;; Memory queries
(iface/remember :my-key "my-value")
(iface/recall :my-key) => "my-value"
(iface/q [{:memory/all [:memory/key :memory/value]}])

;; Combined
(iface/q [:system/healthy? 
          {:introspection/states [:state/id]}
          {:git/commits [:git/hash]}
          :memory/keys])

;; Knowledge queries
(iface/files "src")
(iface/file "bb.edn")
(iface/search "*.clj")
(iface/project)
(iface/q [{[:file-path "README.md"] [:file/content-preview]}])

;; API queries  
(iface/q [{[:url "https://api.github.com/users/github"]
           [:api/status :api/body :api/success?]}])
(iface/http-get "https://api.github.com/users/github")

;; OpenAPI queries
(iface/openapi-bootstrap! :petstore "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json")
(iface/openapi-clients)
(iface/openapi-operations :petstore)
(iface/openapi-call! :petstore :get-inventory {})
```

## Current Capabilities

### Engine
- States: `:uninitialized` → `:initializing` → `:running` → `:stopped`
- Entry points: `engine/boot!`, `engine/stop!`
- Query: `engine/current-state`, `engine/system-status`, `engine/healthy?`

### Query
- Resolvers: `:system/current-state`, `:system/status`, `:system/healthy?`, `:system/meta`
- Entry point: `query/q` (EQL)
- Convenience: `query/status`, `query/full-report`

### Interface
- `iface/boot!` — boot full system
- `iface/shutdown!` — graceful stop
- `iface/q` — query the system
- `iface/status` — quick status
- `iface/report` — full report

## Running the System

```bash
# Boot only
bb boot

# Boot + nREPL
bb nrepl
```

In REPL:
```clojure
(iface/q [:system/status])
(iface/status)
(iface/report)
```

## Git State

- Branch: `main`
- Ahead of origin: 10 commits
- Latest: `571b3f4` — ∿ Add Memory capability - Cross-session persistence

## Known Gaps / Next Steps

1. ~~**History** — Git resolvers for commit history, diffs~~ ✓ Done
2. ~~**Introspection** — Engine queries Engine (meta-statecharts)~~ ✓ Done
3. ~~**Memory** — Cross-session persistence~~ ✓ Done
4. ~~**Knowledge** — File system as queryable graph~~ ✓ Done
5. ~~**API** — HTTP client capabilities~~ ✓ Done
6. ~~**OpenAPI** — OpenAPI specs → callable clients via Martian~~ ✓ Done

**System COMPLETE** — All core capabilities implemented. Next: Feed Forward (AI tooling hooks).

## Active Decisions

- nREPL auto-boots system — trade-off: convenience vs control
- State stored in atoms — simple, not durable
- Pathom resolvers are static — could be dynamically registered
